                        I know I have to grind to make an impact in the world. I
                        believe in the importance of shipping fast while

                        don&apos;t work by the clock â€” i.e. I hate being defined
                        or predisposed to a 9-5, I work to get things done and
                        ship. I&apos;m not perfect, but I can assure you:
                        I&apos;ll put all my energy into trying to get tasks
                        done with an OCD-like attention to detail and

                    The answer is three-fold:
                    <br />
                    a) the mission: I&apos;m a researcher and want to see how
                    applications of AI can help improve the speed and depth of
                    research in academia;
                    <br />
                    b) the company: I think the work environment at Elicit
                    sounds amazing and as someone interested in AI safety and
                    LLMs for their future, this would be an awesome place to
                    grow and learn (don&apos;t worry, I don&apos;t need
                    hand-holding though!);
                    <br />
                    c) I&apos;m a builder by nature and I like shipping fast and
                    iterating through different designs â€” something only an
                    early-stage startup environment would be able to support. I
                    think Elicit could be that place for me!

                    <br />
                    B) I can help ship a user-centric feature out a week â€” I
                    basically built my own &quot;chat with papers&quot; feature
                    on this website (like Charlie) and it only took me an hour

                    I did on transformers and state space models) and would want
                    to help forward AI safety research / LLM research at Elicit.
                    I want to research more. Ironically, the PI of the lab at
                    Princeton that I work at also got his PhD underneath Josh
                    Tenenbaum!
                    <br />
                    D) I do the dirty work â€” I&apos;m always to willing to put
                    in the effort and make sure things are done well and
                    efficiently.
                    <br />
                    E) I learn fast â€” even if it&apos;s an area that I&apos;m
                    not that well-versed in. I want to learn a lot this summer,
                    and I&apos;ll absorb information fast to make Elicit a
                    better product!

                    1) I really want to work on collaborative research in Elicit
                    and understanding what that looks like (i.e., maybe it
                    involves using{" "}
                    <a href="https://liveblocks.io/">Liveblocks</a> â€” I&apos;m
                    not 100% sure, but it would be an amazing feature for Elicit
                    Plus users + it&apos;s a cool challenge and I&apos;d like to
                    explore it!)

                    2)A 0-100 pipeline: sometimes the search box can be
                    intimidating and I don&apos;t really know what to ask. How
                    about build something that probes an idea out of the user
                    and turns it into an actual meaningful product: 0 -&gt; 100.

                    I&apos;ve been interested in Elicit for a{" "}

                    across it in March when I used it for a literature review
                    for my English class, and I&apos;ve been meaning to reach
                    out (no joke, I have an email draft from March). But at the
                    time, I didn&apos;t have the technical skills necessary to
                    be useful for the team, and I didn&apos;t want to waste
                    anyone&apos;s time. Over the past three months, I&apos;ve
                    coded a lot of hobby projects, and finally reached a state
                    where I think I can <span className="italic">actually</span>{" "}
                    contribute to Elicit&apos;s mission as an intern.
                    That&apos;s why I waited. I hope I didn&apos;t wait too
                    long.
